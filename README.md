# das-shiny profiler #

This project is a fork of the original Shiny profiler developed by Aidin Abedi
(see [README.original](README.original.md) for details)

Major changes so far:
* The directory structure is changed. 
* Support of Lua and Ogre is dropped.
* Redundant files are removed.
* The source is modified to better fit my taste 
  (I am not claiming that original version was not good
  I just like it more this way).
  
TODO: Provide some hints on useage.
